Async Autobattler Game Requirements
(IDEA 1)
Core Concept
Create a DevDocs-themed asynchronous autobattler game where players create
characters based on documentation concepts that battle automatically.
Key Game Mechanics
Players create documentation-themed "champions" with unique abilities
Battles occur automatically in the background without real-time player
interaction
Players can check in periodically to see results, upgrade their champions, and
initiate new battles
Implement a simple ranking system to track player performance
Technical Implementation
Build using a chain of AI tools like GPT models for character generation
Use Notion API as the data store and game state manager
Implement simple text-based battle simulation logic
Create a minimalist web interface using Vercel for deployment
Character Creation
Players name their character and select documentation role (Writer, Editor,
Developer, Architect)
AI generates unique abilities based on selected role
Characters have stats like Knowledge, Clarity, Technical Depth, and Speed
IDEA 1 1
Battle System
Characters automatically battle in tournaments
Battle outcomes determined by character stats and abilities
Generate battle reports with AI-created narratives about how the
documentation concepts clashed
Deployment Plan
1. Set up Notion database for character storage and battle results
2. Create AI prompts for character generation and battle simulation
3. Build simple API endpoints to handle game actions
4. Deploy minimal web interface for player interaction
5. Test with a small group before wider release
Implementation Resources
- Use devdocs.ai for documentation-based character traits
- Leverage Pipedream for workflow automation between systems
- Implement a simple state machine for battle mechanics
- Use AI-generated descriptions for battle outcomes and character abilities
Monetization Ideas (Future)
Offer premium character templates
Allow purchases of special abilities
Tournament entry fees for special competitions
